# Elfsight PHP Home Task

Hi there,

Welcome to the next stage of our hiring process! We're excited to have you tackle this home task.

## The Task

Create a service that meets the following requirements:

### Functional Requirements

-   A user should be able to submit a review for a **Rick and Morty** episode (you can get the episode list from the [public API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-episodes)).
-   Each review will be automatically rated (on a scale from 0 to 1) using **sentiment analysis**.
-   A user can request an episode's summary, which includes:
    -   the episode name;
    -   release date;
    -   average sentiment score;
    -   last 3 reviews for that episode.

### Non-Functional Requirements

-   The service should be accessible via an HTTP API.
-   It should be built using **PHP** and **Symfony** _(recommended)_ or **Laravel**.
-   The database can be either **MySQL**/**MariaDB** or **PostgreSQL**.
-   The application should be free of bugs and function smoothly.
-   It should be set up for containerization and be ready to run locally using Docker Compose.
-   _(Optional, but recommended)_ Include tests to ensure the service works correctly.

## Hints

-   You don't need to implement sentiment analysis from scratch. Feel free to use an existing API or open-source library for that.
-   Identity and access management isn't a focus for this task, so you can skip authentication or implement a simple solution.

If you have any questions or run into issues, don't hesitate to reach out.

Good luck, and happy coding!
